**10 Prioritized Requirements**
1.  Implement quality control measures to ensure that each salad adheres to established standards for taste, appearance, and portion size.
2.  As a health-conscious customer, I expect the Chef Salad to use fresh, organic, and locally sourced ingredients to ensure that the salads are nutritious and packed with flavor.
3.  The RT5000 app must incorporate a "Helpdesk" feature that allows users to access customer support, submit support tickets, and request assistance for troubleshooting or technical problems related to their robot.
4.  Task Customization: The app should support customization of tasks by allowing users to input various parameters, such as task duration, cleaning path, and specific actions to be performed during the task.
5.  The RT5000 app must feature a search function that allows users to quickly find and select recipes based on keywords or ingredients, ensuring efficient and convenient access to desired meals.
6.  Scheduled Task Execution: The RT5000 must allow users to schedule tasks through the app, specifying the date and time when the robot should start and complete a specific household task.
7.  The app must include a "Child Lock" feature that can be easily activated and deactivated by the parent, preventing any unauthorized access or modifications to the RT5000's tasks.
8.  Accommodate dietary restrictions and preferences by offering customizable salad options, including vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, and protein-rich choices.
9.  Obstacle Avoidance: The robot should be equipped with sensors and algorithms to detect and avoid obstacles while performing tasks, ensuring safety and preventing collisions.
10.  The RT5000 app must include an "Emergency Shutdown" feature that allows users to immediately halt all of the robot's tasks in case of unexpected situations or emergencies, ensuring user safety.
